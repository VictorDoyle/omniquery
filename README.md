## Overview

**OmniQuery** is an advanced SQL query optimization tool designed to help developers write efficient SQL queries effortlessly. Many developers inadvertently create inefficient queries that can lead to significant performance bottlenecks. With OmniQuery, you can analyze your SQL queries in real time, receiving actionable suggestions to optimize them and improve the performance of your database interactions.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Optimization Suggestions**: Integrates seamlessly with popular ORM libraries like Sequelize and TypeORM, analyzing your SQL queries as you write them. OmniQuery provides instant feedback and recommendations for optimization.

- **Performance Estimates**: Hover over your SQL queries to view expected execution times for various dataset sizes (10,000, 100,000, and 1,000,000 rows). For example, after typing a query like `SELECT * FROM USERS`, you’ll see a tooltip indicating “Expected to take 3500ms for 10K results, 9000ms for 100K results, 35000ms for 1M results.”

- **Pattern Recognition**: Automatically identifies inefficient query patterns and suggests alternative strategies to enhance performance, ensuring your applications run smoothly even with large datasets.

- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generate reports that detail the performance of your SQL queries over time, helping you track improvements and maintain best practices in your codebase.

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed for developers of all skill levels, OmniQuery features an intuitive interface that simplifies the optimization process without overwhelming users with technical jargon.

## Getting Started with OmniQuery

### Installation

To start using OmniQuery, install it via npm with the following command:

```bash
npm install omniquery --save-dev
```

### Integrating with Your ORM

Once installed, you can easily integrate OmniQuery with your existing ORM setup. Here's a quick example using Sequelize:

```Javascript
const { Sequelize } = require('sequelize');
const OmniQuery = require('omniquery');

const sequelize = new Sequelize('database', 'username', 'password', {
  host: 'localhost',
  dialect: 'mysql',
});

// init OmniQuery
const optimizer = new OmniQuery(sequelize);

// Use OmniQuery to analyze your SQL queries
optimizer.analyzeQuery('SELECT * FROM USERS').then((result) => {
  console.log(result); // Displays optimization suggestions and performance estimates
});

```

OmniQuery can analyze any SQL query you write within your ORM's context. As you type, you will receive real-time feedback. For instance:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM USERS WHERE age > 18

```

As you hover over this query, OmniQuery will provide performance estimates like:

Expected to take 4200ms for 10K results
Expected to take 9500ms for 100K results
Expected to take 37000ms for 1M results
